tasks.py

This module is responsible for the dynamic generation of the main prompts
(tasks) that are assigned to the AutoGen agent teams.

It acts as a prompt factory, abstracting the complexity of assembling the
correct guidance files, source content, and runtime instructions into a
single, coherent prompt. By centralising prompt construction here, the main
orchestration logic in `orchestrator.py` remains clean and focused on workflow
management rather than prompt engineering.

The module provides functions to create tasks for:
- Initial document creation (`get_creation_task`).
- Document correction/revision (`get_correction_task`).
- Kicking off the validation process (`run_validation_async`).
